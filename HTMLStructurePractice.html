          Dogs are friendly and loyal animals that make great pets. They love to
          play, go for walks, and spend time with their families. Many dogs
          enjoy learning tricks and are happy when they are praised. They come
          in all shapes and sizes, from small and fluffy to big and strong. Dogs
          are known for being great companions and bringing joy to people's
          lives.

          Coffee is a popular drink made from roasted coffee beans. Many people
          enjoy it in the morning because it helps them feel awake and alert. It
          can be served hot or cold and made in different ways, like black, with
          milk, or with sugar. Coffee has a rich smell and a strong taste that
          many people love. It's also a common drink to enjoy while relaxing or
          talking with friends.

          Paper Rex (PRX), the Valorant team from the Pacific region, won the
          Masters Toronto 2025 tournament by defeating Fnatic (from EMEA) in the
          grand final with a 3-1 victory. This marked PRX’s first international
          title, breaking their “runner‑up curse” after previous near-misses in
          Masters Copenhagen and Champions events. Their in-game leader f0rsakeN
          earned Finals MVP honors for his standout performance and clutch calls
          throughout the series.
